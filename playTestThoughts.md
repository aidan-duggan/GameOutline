Play Test 1 12/5 rules:https://github.com/aidan-duggan/RugbyCardGame/tree/v0.1 :

* Too many 4s?
* Pick up cards from tied down too often?
* Lots of hands to look at, 15 is a lot to hold.
* What should happen with a draw? go to who won last? stay still? possible turn over risk?
* Feels like defense should always just do 6's ?
