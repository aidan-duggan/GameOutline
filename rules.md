#### Anatomy of Skill Card

There are 2 decks, one for forwards and one for backs

Each card is in two halves. Attack and Defense.

Attack half consists of:
* Player: Back or Forward
* Type: Pass, Run or Special 
* Value: numbers 2 - 4 (to be ironed out)
* (??? A symbol that repsents the risk of a knock on or a penalty)

Attack Examples:
* Long Pass, Pop Pass
* Weave run, Crash ball
* Pick & Go, Kick

Defense half to be determined, for now they will be the same as attack.

#### State Tracking Cards

* 1 score and field position tracking card
* 1 time remaining tracking card
* Set piece cards

* Set Piece Cards *
These cards outline the starting position of the teams at a Set Piece.

Each side must do the following:
* Scrum - 6 Forwards are put in the tied up pile
* Lineout - 4/6/8 Forwards are put in the tied up pile
* Kickoff/Reset - No players are put in the tied up pile.

### Game Setup 

Shuffle the play and skills deck.

Layout the tracking cards and place counters on the starting positions.

Determine who will be the first attacking player.

Setup a Reset Set Piece.

### Set Piece Setup

There are 3 types of Set Pieces, Reset/Kickoff, Lineout & Scrum.

At the start of each set piece, create the team decks. Do this by drawing 6 backs cards from the backs skills deck and 8 forwards cards from the forwards skills deck for each player. This is the collection of cards each team will have until the next set piece. Then place the appropriate number of skill cards listed on the Set Piece card in the tied up deck.

The attack player draws X play cards.

### Play

Play is made of a collection of phases between set pieces. In each phase the attacker chooses a play card, then both players use their skill cards to determine the level of success or failure of the play. This pattern is repeated until either the attacker scores, possesion changes hands, or a new set piece occurs.

_Steps of a Play_
* Attacker chooses a play card that they have the player to do.
* Attacker tells the defender how many players and what type they are.
* Defender chooses skill cards of the matching type and number.
* Reveal the play card and each sides skill cards.
* The defender can draw one random card from their remaining cards.
* If they do the attacker can do also once.
* Resolve the play card.
* If the play brings the attack over the try line and possession has not changed, a try is scored and the team awarded 7 points.

_Resolve Play Card_

Resolve the play card, by comparing the skill on the play card against the matching skill on the played skill cards. Skill cards that don't match the player type of play card are worth half.

* Sum the value of the matching skill for attackers and defenders.
  * Half if the player type doesn't match.
* Check against the play cards result table
  * Move the ball marker forward or backwards on the territory tracker the stated amount.
  * If a set piece icon appears, then the play ends and a new play begins with defender now the attacker. Start with the shown set piece.
  * Resolve if a penalty or knock on has occurred.

_Resolve if a penalty or knock on has occurred_
When trying to beat a defender, smashing an attacker, or pull off a complex move, sometimes things go too far. The player can knock the ball on, or give away a penalty. 

When you see the (P ???) symbol there is a chase that possession will switch with either a knock on, penalty or the ball going into touch. 

TODO some determination of the odds of this happening.

Possession always switches to whoever was on the lossing side of the skill check. So too strong an attack can lead to the defender wining the ball for example.
* For knock on, play restarts with a scrum set piece.
* For ball into touch, play restarts with a line out set piece.
* For a penalty, the now attacking player can choose:
  * A Scrum Set Piece in the current location
  * A Lineout Set piece 2 places forward
  * A shot at goals.

_Shot at Goals_

TODO determine odds of this.

#### Tracking Time
After a fixed period of time, the next set piece that is not from a penalth ends the half, and play restarts 

TODO figure out time tracking.

### Winning

The game ends after 2 halfs are played, with the team with the most points winning.
